In the beginning of this assignment, I decided to go for a simple and sleek design.
The reason for this is because I thought a sleeker design would be a lot more easier on the eye,
and this way I can focus on the code basics and add more details as I go along.
Upon reflection I added more details than I thought I would be able too, as I thought I would struggle a lot more with this assignment than I did.
I did find it difficult to make the website look visually appealing, I was able to identify certain aspects of other websites
in which I liked, but I struggle to execute those ideas into my own website.
Through this assignment I become quite comfortable with code and even enjoyed it.
I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the point of wanting to add more details, such as the nav bar animation.
As I genuinely didn't think I would get to that point, I really lacked confidence in my ability in the beginning.
I did struggle with a few things, the photo grid on the index page especially.
Trying to get the photo grid to position the way that I wanted took a few goes, mostly just in terms of all the different types of padding involved.
The initial nav bar also took me a few tries, just because of how intricate it seemed to be to make it layout in such a simple and basic way.
In terms of visual aspects, I think the home page looks the best. 
I do wish I experimented more with different layout designs, I just wasn't sure of how to make it look good at the time.
I really wanted to add more elements, such as social media icons.
I watched a fair few tutorials on it and was quite confused, I just wasn't sure if I was doing it right or if it required javascript or bootstrap.
I wish I was able to add them, I think it would have definitely made my footer look a lot better.
I left the footer empty as I wasn't sure what else to put into it besides the social media icons.
The biggest struggle I have found whilst creating the website was trying to make it responsive, I had watched an obsurd amount of tutorials,
as well as reading different explanations and code examples.
And no matter what, the slightest change I made within my code would then throw everything else off.
I have learned in an excruciating way that making a website responsive should be considered at the begining rather than closer to the end,
because I have not been able to convert mine into being responsive very succesfully.
Every time I would try to adjust the main cover image on the pages, it would throw everything else out of place.
After many hours I managed to get almost everything to a somewhat pleasant responsive point.
As a first attempt I am pretty impressed with what I managed to accomplish, as I didn't think I would be able to do most of what I managed.
Though the website could use a lot of improvements, i'm genuinely surprised and happy with what I have done so far.
I have learnt a lot and there are a lot of things I would like to continue to learn how to change and to improve, 
I am genuinely surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did.
