         <h1> About Us </h1>

         <h4>Contour 556 is Canberra's biennial public art festival, <br> curated by Neil Hobbs.</h4>

    <div class="aboutparagraph">
         <p>
         Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event in name as well as in purpose to the history of the central Canberra landscape.</p>
        
        <p>The artworks and installations selected for the festival respond in some way to Canberra's history, from 50,000 years to the present day. </p>
        <p> Contour 556 will therefore offer the Canberra, Australian and international community a unique opportunity to engage with and understand the layers of Canberra's history through art. </p>
